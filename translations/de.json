  "intro": "Unsere moderne Welt wäre ohne <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model'>Open Source Software</a> undenkbar. Sie läuft auf jedem Computer, jedem Smartphone oder Tablet and all deine Lieblings-Apps kommen nicht ohne sie aus. Sie wird hauptsächlich von Freiwilligen auf der ganzen Welt entwickelt. Open Source software ist ein freies Allgemeingut und erlaubt jedem, sie zu benutzen und an die eigenen Bedürfnisse anzupassen. Sie basiert auf der Expertise einzelner und der Schwarmintelligenz einer riesigen Community anstatt auf Vorgaben von Vorgesetzen. All diese wertvolle Arbeit wird nicht bezahlt! Utopian.io ändert das und entlohnt jeden der zu solchen Projekten beiträgt, solange ein gewisser Qualitätsstandard eingehalten wird.",

This software runs on every device, website and application you can think of. It is often created by volunteers, hobbyists and enthusiasts who selflessly dedicate their time and effort to the cause.</p><p>Utopian is building an open source economy, in which the people who make valuable contributions to open source software projects get rewarded for their hard work. Built ontop of the Steem blockchain, Utopian uses the wisdom of the crowd to reward valuable contributions. Project owners and other contributors all get to decide how rewards are distributed through voting or liking individual contributions, and they also have the option to support contributors directly by paying them in a cryptocurrency called STEEM, which can easily be traded for other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>"

These new tokens are distributed continuously to people performing actions deemed valuable by their communities through community voting. In the case of the Utopian community, as project owners, fellow contributors and other people with vested interests in open source software development \"upvote\" or \"like\" contributions, they have a say in how these new tokens are distributed, in direct relation to their stake in the Steem ecosystem (i.e. how much Steem Power they have).
